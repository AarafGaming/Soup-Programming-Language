This is a programming language made by me that is made in python that is still in progress. 
If you use Soup60.py only it looks like a terminal.
If you use SoupCompiler.py you can compile SoupLang Code into Python Code
Soup60.py uses an interpreter
Soup60CompilerSupport.py is just Suoup60.py but with an export command and with that you can compile all the code into python code
